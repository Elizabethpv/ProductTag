## Why E-commerce and tagging ?

From startups to small businesses right through to huge brands, there are a huge number of companies that can benefit from their own ecommerce website, where they can sell their own products or services. In todayâ€™s competitive and convenience focused society, no longer do consumers want to venture to the high street in order to buy items, instead consumers want to shop from their own homes, making ecommerce a flexible solution for both businesses and buyers.

With E-commerce gaining more popularity day after day the number of products available for shopping are also increasing. With this increasing trend it is extremely difficult to tag products like clothes,bag,watches to be tagged manually. So this was a small attempt made to use machine learning for easing out this task.
