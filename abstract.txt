Project Tag for Ecommerce website

This project proposes an automatic tag assignment
approach to various e-commerce products
where tag allotment is done solely based
on the visual features in the image. 
The explosive growth of e-commerce products
being sold online has made manual annotation
infeasible. Without such tags it’s impossible
for customers to be able to find these products.
Hence a scalable approach catering to
such large number of product images and allocating
meaningful tags is essential and could
be used to make an efficient tag based product
retrieval system.
In this project propose one such approach
based on feature extraction using Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks to learn descriptive
semantic features from product images.
